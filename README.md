# Internship Task Project 🚀

This is a task-based project built with **Next.js** as part of an internship application assignment. The project demonstrates core frontend concepts such as routing, authentication, and UI design using templates, and includes functional components like a splash screen, user authentication, and a basic task dashboard.
